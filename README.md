# Through – Interactive Digital Artwork

**Through** is an interactive digital artwork exploring rhythm, perception, and sensory experience.  
It integrates cartographic data (urban walk floor plans) into a virtual scene that evolves based on user engagement.

This interactive project explores how repetitive movement and sensory experiences influence shifts in mental states. Drawing inspiration from the ambient, meditative nature of walking and the atmospheric qualities of 1990s experimental electronic music, the artwork evokes a sense of rhythm and immersion.

There are three types of movement within the space.
The first type occurs through the rotation of maps representing floor plans of walks I have taken in urban environment. 
The second type involves elements that move within the sphere from which the user observes the environment while remaining idle.
These two movements unfold autonomously and endlessly. 
The third type of movement, however, is triggered by the user’s interaction with the virtual space. 
The second type of movement is influenced by both the first and third, causing the elements within the sphere to move in groups and form continuously flowing patterns.
When specific patterns emerge, a corresponding artwork is generated. This artwork can then be resized and repositioned anywhere on the screen. 
If the conditions that produced an artwork reoccur, the artwork is replaced by a modified version of itself. Over time, this position alternates between two evolving variations of the piece.
Through this process, walking is explored as a mechanism, a rhythm, and an experience that shapes the walker's perception and interaction with their environment.
