# Through – Interactive Digital Artwork

**Through** is an interactive digital artwork exploring rhythm, perception, and sensory experience.  
It integrates cartographic data (urban walk floor plans) into a virtual scene that evolves based on user engagement.

## Features
- Developed using **Three.js**  
- Interactive space with three movement types:
  - Two autonomous with random rhythms  
  - One driven by the user’s rhythm  
- Synchronization events reveal hidden elements in the scene  
- Inspired by **ambient/experimental 90s electronic music** and **spatial perception research**

## Installation
